Equations are sourced from the US EPA's regulations (2009). Global warming potentials come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2021). Fuel emissions factors are gathered from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2010). Electricity emissions factors are sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (2022).
